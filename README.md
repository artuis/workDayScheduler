# Work Day Scheduler

Simple calendar application which saves user events for hours of 9AM to 5PM. Moment is used to update the date and determine which hours have passed

## Operation
Clicking on a colored box will allow the user to enter in an event associated with the hour to the left of the textbox. Clicking the blue floppy icon saves the inputted text in local storage, so refreshing the page will not remove previously inputted text. Events from past hours will have a gray background, current hour will have a red background, and future events will have a green background.

The current date is also stored in local storage, so if the day changes, the events are automatically cleared.
